This should be split apart into four autonomous packages:

 1. The contents of constellation.lib are a fork of planet's
    distributed planet.py script, wrapped in a Python function.
    It should be merged into planet itself and planet.py should
    be refactored to use this function.

 2. A Deliverance-friendly Planet output template, intended to
    be used as a base and forked.

 3. Constellation itself: that is, the Planet farm; admin interface
    to managing a Planet configuration (writing configuration files
    from a Django template); API for updating a managed Planet and
    bulk updating script; and serving of the published planet output.
    
 4. Social features: overriding the base Planet template with a
    Django template that layers dynamic social features (commenting,
    liking, archiving) on top of river items.

Also things should be added:

 * An activity stream
 * Tagging of items in the linkbank
 * Tagging of channels (with fed items inheriting tags from their
   source channel)
